Website designed with React, HTML5, and CSS3 to create a decision wheel application. It allows the user to add their own decision items. The user can then choose to hide or delete those items from the wheel. All items are added to localStorage, so they will be saved for future use. Website: projects/WheelyGoodChoices/
